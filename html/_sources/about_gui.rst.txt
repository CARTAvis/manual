========================
Graphical User Interface
========================

CARTA provides the freedom to let users define customized layout with desired functionalities 
suitable for their science need. There are also few pre-defined layouts for users to easily 
switch in between. In this section, we will decompose the ideas of the GUI into three parts: 
*Components*, *Layout*, and *Link Mechanism*. We end this section by giving a few customized 
layouts in order to stimulate yours imaginations.

Components
----------

Once CARTA is launched, we should see a window like the following figure. The window consists of
a *main working area* with a pre-defined layout, as well as *menu*, *tool*, and *status* bars. 
The three bars can be hidden via *Preference* in the menu bar or via the right-click pop-up
menu.

.. figure:: figures/gui_components.png

The content shown in the menu bar changes dynamically with the activated panel assigned to
a specific functionality. The activated panel is highlighted with a box in cyan color. By
default, the big panel on the left, which is assigned to ``imageViewer``, is activated. You
are encouraged to click on different panels to see how the content of the menu bar changes. 
Except *Session* and *Layout*, a pop-up list with other options in the menu bar can be triggered 
by right-click on a panel.

The tool bar provides handy buttons for two purposes: *color clipping* and *region of interests*.
This bar is greyed out if the activated panel is not relevant to these two tools. For example, if 
you click on the upper right panel (assigned to ``statistics``), the tool bar will be greyed out.

The status bar reports messages if CARTA detects invalid input values. For example, if you change 
value from 0 to 2 in the ``colormap`` shown in the middle right panel, a warning message in
red color will be present in the status bar.

Layout
------

CARTA has four pre-defined layouts with groups of functionalities (accessible with the 
dropdown menu in the menu bar):  

(from top to bottom, left to right)

* Default Layout: ``imageViewer``, ``statistics``, ``colormap``, ``animator``
* LineAnalysis Layout: ``imageViewer``, ``profiler``, ``colormap``, ``animator``
* HistogramAnalysis Layout: ``imageViewer``, ``histogram``, ``colormap``, ``animator``
* Image Composite Layout: ``imageViewer``, ``imageContext``, ``imageZoom``, ``colormap``, ``animator``

For example, if you want to inspect the line profile of your target source, 
*LineAnalysis Layout* should be the suitable layout.

However, if none of the pre-defined layouts fits your science need, it is possible to
create a customized layout in CARTA. To create a regular grid layout , e.g., two by two, 
you can click the *Custom Layout* in the dropdown menu *Layout* of the menu bar.

To create a non-regular grid layout, like the following figure for example, you can start 
with the *Default Layout* and use *Window* -> *Add* to divide the panels and use 
*Window* -> *Remove* to merge panels.

With *Window* -> *Move*, the functionality of a panel can be transferred to a destination
panel. This can be achieved by dragging an arrow from the blue circle to the black 
circle. To confirm the action, click on the ``OK`` button. To cancel the action,
press ``escape`` key. If the destination panel has undefined functionality, it will be
assigned to the same functionality as the origin panel and the origin panel will 
become undefined. If the destination panel has been assigned to a certain functionality,
it will be *replaced* by the functionality of the origin panel and the origin panel
becomes undefined. It is advised to use *Move* with caution since it is irreversible.

A panel can be maximized or minimized via *Window* -> *Maximize* or *Minimize*. Use 
*Window* -> *Restore* to restore a maximized panel. Minimized panel will become a button in the
status bar (aligned to the right). Click on it to restore the panel. 

To assign the functionality to each panel, click on a panel then click on the dropdown menu
*View* in the menu bar to select a functionality. Or you can right-click on a panel and use the
*View* menu to select a functionality.

Link Mechanism
--------------

Suppose we have made a customized layout with a set of functionalities. Now we need to
make these functionalities to work together. This is achieved by the *Link Mechanism* in CARTA.
Right-click on the source panel and use *Links* to initiate the link operation. By drawing an arrow 
from the source panel to the destination panel and press ``escape`` key to confirm, the destination 
panel can communicate with the source panel. For example, once a link between the ``colormap`` panel and 
``imageViewer`` panel has established, users can use ``colormap`` to change to coloring of the image shown
in the ``imageViewer`` panel. Right-click on the blue circle allows users to remove the link between two
panels.

.. figure:: figures/gui_make_a_link.png

Except the core functionality ``imageViewer`` itself, all other functionalities can link to ``imageViewer``.
``colormap`` can link to ``histogram`` as well, providing color options to histogram. The following
figure summarizes the link relationship of the current available functionalities.
