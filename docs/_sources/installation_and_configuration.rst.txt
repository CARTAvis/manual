operating system and is not publicly available. For people who want to use CARTA-server as the 
user interface for their image archive, please contact carta_helpdesk@asiaa.sinica.edu.tw 
for more information. CARTA-desktop can be retrieved at 
https://github.com/CARTAvis/carta/releases/tag/v0.9

Configuring CARTA
-----------------

Plugin configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CARTA is built on a *plugin* model and can be configured by a ``json`` file if desired. The default
plugin configuration should work for most of users. The plugin configuration file 
is located at::

  <your home>/.cartavis/config.json

and the default plugin configuration looks like::

  {
    "_comment" : "List of plugin directories",
    "pluginDirs": [
        "$(APPDIR)/../plugins",
        "$(APPDIR)/../../../../plugins"
    ],
    "disabledPlugins" : [""],
    "plugins": {
        "PCacheSqlite3" : {
            "dbPath": "$(HOME)/CARTA/cache/pcache.sqlite"
        }
    },
    "qtDecorations" : "true",
    "percentileApproximation" : "true",
    "percentApproxDividedNum" : 1000000
}
  
If you want to disable a certain plugin, for example ``PCacheSqlite3``,
you can add ``"PCacheSqlite3"`` to the ``"disabledPlugins"`` list. 


Preference configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CARTA provides the following user configurable options:

* percentile approximation::

  "percentileApproximation" : "true",
  "percentApproxDividedNum" : 1000000

  By default, CARTA adopts an approximation algorithm to find the clipping values 
  in the image cube in order to provide good performance for big image cube. Note that
  with this approximation algorithm (1000000 histogram bins), the bounding values of a 
  certain clipping percentage may differ a bit from the exact values.

* sqlite cache::

  "PCacheSqlite3" : {"dbPath": "$(HOME)/CARTA/cache/pcache.sqlite"}

  CARTA adopts sqlite database to cache data values in order to enhance performance. 
  For example, the minimum and maximum values of a certain image cube will be cached 
  in sqlite database so that when this image cube is opened for the second time, the 
  step of finding minimum and maximum values is skipped (usually very expensive for big 
  image cubes). Note that currently CARTA uses the file name of the image as the key in 
  sqlite database. Therefore, the cached values are not applicable to a totally different 
  image with an identical file name. Users may manually remove the cache at 
  <your home>/CARTA/cache/pcache.sqlite. CARTA team will improve this aspect in the 
  near future.
