A Quick Hands-on
################

Assuming you just received your exciting ALMA/JVLA image cubes and want to have 
a glance, this section provides a step by step guide to learn how to use CARTA to 

1. open an image cube with ``imageViewer``, then
2. select a color palette to render the image cube with ``colormap``, then
3. navigate through different channels with ``animator``, then
4. use mouse to perform *zoom* and *pan* operations

For more detailed descriptions, please refer to the Sections :ref:`link_about_gui` and
:ref:`link_functionalities_gui`.

**Step 0**: Launch CARTA and we should see a window like the following figure. This is the 
pre-defined default layout with different panels assigned to different functionalities.

**Step 1**: Open an image cube with ``imageViewer``. Click the dropdown menu called ``data`` 
at the *menu bar* and click ``open`` to open up the file browser.

CARTA includes some sample images at the default lookup path::

In this tutorial, we will open *HD163296_CO_2_1_zoom.image.fits* by clicking the ``load``
button. Don't forget to click the ``close`` button to close the file browser. Now we should 
see a window like the following figure, which includes ``imageViewer``, ``colormap``, 
``animator`` and ``statistics``. Note that the content of the *menu bar* is dynamic. This 
means that it only shows the options belonging to an activated panel assigned to a specific 
functionality. The following figure demonstrates that ``imageViewer`` is being activated 
(highlighted in cyan color) with the options like *Clipping*, *Zoom Reset*, etc., in the *menu bar*.

**Step 2**: Select a color palette to render the image cube with ``colormap``. The default 
color palette of the raster image is gray in linear scale between the minimum and maximum 
pixel values of the whole image cube. To change to other color palette, click the 
``colormap`` panel to activate it. We should see the menu bar updates accordingly. Use 
the dropdown menu to select *nipy_spectral*, for example. Now we should see a window like 
the following figure.

**Step 3**: Navigate through different channels with ``animator``. First of all, activate 
``animator`` by clicking the panel. Again, we should see the menu bar is updated. Then, 
use the horizontal slide bar to navigate through different channels. In the following figure,
we stop at channel 26. You may use the cursor to hover over the control buttons to see what
they can do. For example, you can click the second button from the right to start playing the
animation and use the middle button to stop playing.

**Step 4**: Use mouse to perform *zoom* and *pan* operations. CARTA relies on mouse operations
to zoom and pan your image. By scrolling up/down, you can zoom in/out the image. Note that if 
you want to inspect a feature, you can hover over it before scrolling up to zoom in. The feature 
you hovered over will be focused on while zooming in. If you want to focus on a feature without
changing the zoom level, simply by double-clicking on the feature. You can reset the zoom level 
and re-center the image by click ``Zoom Reset`` button and ``Pan Reset`` button, respectively. Try
to see if you can reproduce the image in the following figure.

images with CARTA and make a great discovery!
